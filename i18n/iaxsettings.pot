"Asterisk: codecpriority. Controls the codec negotiation of an inbound IAX "
"call. This option is inherited to all user entities.  It can also be defined "
"in each user entity separately which will override the setting here. The "
"valid values are:<br />host - Consider the host's preferred order ahead of "
"the caller's.<br />caller - Consider the callers preferred order ahead of "
"the host's.<br /> disabled - Disable the consideration of codec preference "
"altogether. (this is the original behavior before preferences were added)"

"requested format is not available the call will only be accepted if the "
"requested format is available."

"Asterisk: forcejitterbuffer. Forces the use of a jitterbuffer on the receive "
"side of an IAX channel. Normally the jitter buffer will not be used if "
"receiving a jittery channel but sending it off to another channel such as a "
"SIP channel to an endpoint, since there is typically a jitter buffer at the "
"far end. This will force the use of the jitter buffer before sending the "
"stream on. This is not typically desired as it adds additional latency into "
"the stream."

"Asterisk: jitterbuffer. You can adjust several parameters relating to the "
"jitter buffer. The jitter buffer's function is to compensate for varying "
"network delay. The jitter buffer works for INCOMING audio - the outbound "
"audio will be dejittered by the jitter buffer at the other end."

"Asterisk: maxjitterbuffer. Max length of the jitterbuffer in milliseconds."
"<br /> Asterisk: resyncthreshold. When the jitterbuffer notices a "
"significant change in delay that continues over a few frames, it will "
"resync, assuming that the change in delay was caused by a timestamping mix-"
"up. The threshold for noticing a change in delay is measured as twice the "
"measured jitter plus this resync threshold. Resyncing can be disabled by "
"setting this parameter to -1."

"Asterisk: maxjitterinterps. The maximum number of interpolation frames the "
"jitterbuffer should return in a row. Since some clients do not send CNG/DTX "
"frames to indicate silence, the jitterbuffer will assume silence has begun "
"after returning this many interpolations. This prevents interpolating "
"throughout a long silence."
